# About

PluGaMa is a KoGaMa extension created to improve the user experience by injecting plugins suggested by users. It currently on Chrome or any other Chromium based browser.

# Installation

Download the folder into a zip file and extract it. Afterwards, go to the managed extensions tab of your browser. Click load unpacked and select the folder you extracted.

# Usage

By default, the plugins for the extension come with the folder and can be turned on and off if needed. However if I on any occasion add a new plugin, it will not automatically update with it. You will have to download it manually into the extension's plugin folder from the Github or through the extension itself.

# Disclaimer

This plugin **does not** give others an unfair advantage in-game. It only runs outside the game and I am not responsible for any ban or termination of your account if you use it maliciously. Remember to follow KoGaMa's ToS.
