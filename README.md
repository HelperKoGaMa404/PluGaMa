# About

PluGaMa is a KoGaMa extension created to improve the user experience by injecting plugins suggested by users. It currently on Chrome or any other Chromium based browser.

# Installation

Download the folder into a zip file and extract it. Afterwards, go to the managed extensions tab of your browser. Click load unpacked and select the folder you extracted. You will now see the extension in your extension list.

# Usage

By default, the plugins for the extension come with the folder and can be turned on and off if needed. However if I on any occasion add a new plugin, it will not automatically update with it. You will have to download it manually into the extension's plugin folder from the Github or through the extension itself.

You can search and filter out plugins in the extension to find what you need.
